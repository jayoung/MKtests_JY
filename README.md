# Overview
R functions to perform McDonald-Kreitman tests

Can polarize changes if an outgroup is provided

# To do

In the individual tests, add option to suppress file output

Add frequency filter

To help troubleshooting, make a trim function, to consider only some portions of the alignment (and it might be useful in general)


Add alternative input methods eg separate input files for each population (and outgroup) - that would allow a script

Check it works on Rini data as before

Check it works on Arp53D polarized and unpolarized like before

Add methods tab to spreadsheet to capture parameters and warnings, perhaps also a tab to name the seqs used
