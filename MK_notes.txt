##### git hub syncs:

# set up repo for the first time:
set up a new repo on the github website - I wish I had not done this step
made a README.md file
git init
git add --all . 
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/jayoung/MKtests_JY.git
git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories
git push -u origin main

# subsequent updates:
git add --all . 
   (the --all also lets it take care of files I remove locally, also removing them from the server)
git commit
    opens up a file in vim where I can make notes about what I've changed. 
    "i" gets me into edit mode in vim
    "escape" gets me out of edit mode
    :wq to save and exit vim
